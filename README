Nautilus Hide
=============

A simple Nautilus extension that adds “Hide” and “Unhide” to Nautilus
right-click menu


Details
-------

**Nautilus Hide** does not add a leading dot to file names, but relies on
Nautilus' ability to hide the files that are listed in a `.hidden` file (to be
found in the same directory).

The extension erases the `.hidden` files when these are empty and is able to
handle selections of files that are distributed across multiple locations.

If a file is not immediately hidden/unhidden, press `Ctrl` + `R` or `F5` to
refresh the viewport.


Get involved
------------

The package needs help with internationalization. If a translation into your
language is missing and you wish to get involved, here is what to do.

Let's say you want to create a Dutch translation of **Nautilus Hide**. This
package comes with only a bunch of strings to translate, whose most important
ones are:

1. “Hide file(s)”
2. “Hide the selected file(s)”
3. “Unhide file(s)”
4. “Unhide the selected file(s)”

Other translatable strings are only debug messages sent to the standard error
stream and can be left untraslated.

First thing to do is to make sure that `gettext` and `intltool` are installed
on your system. Then clone this repository and launch the following four
commands:

```
cd nautilus-hide/po
intltool-update -p
msginit -l nl
rm nautilus-hide.pot
```

Now edit the `po/LINGUAS` file and add a new line containing the abbreviated
name of the new language (`nl`).

Finally, open the `po/nl.po` file and translate the strings above. All you have
to do now is to commit your changes.

For any issue, [drop me a message][1].
